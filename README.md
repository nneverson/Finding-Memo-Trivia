## Technology Used
- Css
- HTML
- Java Script

## Major Hurdles

- Centering text with CSS. When "text align: center" didn't work I had to resort to using the padding and margin to move text. Often that affected the way other things on the page were arranged so I had to resort to experimenting with different alignment properties. 

- Java Script. My code isn't dry but I am grateful that  was able to get things to work with the help of my teachers and the internet.

- Github. I have changed the name of my project not know that it would affect the way github would track the file. The problem was resolved after a few minutes of searching google, not without some anxiety of course.
